* description = "This statement defines the expected capabilities of a system containing data (typically patient data, but could be situational awareness data) 
that will be evaluated against one or more measures. This may be a FHIR server, an EHR with a FHIR endpoint (facade), an internal data store when the Data Source

such as situational awareness data that is reporting via CSV or other format. When FHIR enabled, the Data Source acts as a 
[US Core Server](https://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/STU6.1/CapabilityStatement-us-core-server.html)"
