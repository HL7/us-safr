dQM Reporting. The dQM Evaluation Engine queries the Measure Source for the latest Measure content before querying the Patient Data Source and performing measure evaluation. 
The Measure Source acts as a [CQFM Publishable Measure Repository](https://hl7.org/fhir/us/cqfmeasures/measure-repository-service.html#publishable-measure-repository)."
