the result against the profiles in this implementation guide, and potentially other measure-specific profiles that are distributed with the measures themselves. The MeasureReport Recipient acts as a 
[DEQM Receiver Server](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/us/davinci-deqm/STU4/CapabilityStatement-receiver-server.html), provides write access to Bundle resources containing 
MeasureReport and other related resources, and implements the $validate operation."
