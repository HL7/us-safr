# 01 - IG Defined CodeSystem represents a CodeSystem defined by NHSN specifically for the program that this IG addresses. This IG defines the CodeSystem for use of these codes in the FHIR ecosystem
INFORMATION: CodeSystem/HRDSupplyDaysCS: CodeSystem: Most code systems defined in HL7 IGs will need to move to THO later during the process. Consider giving this code system a THO URL now (See https://confluence.hl7.org/display/TSMG/Terminology+Play+Book, and/or talk to TSMG)
INFORMATION: CodeSystem/SAFRHRDCS: CodeSystem: Most code systems defined in HL7 IGs will need to move to THO later during the process. Consider giving this code system a THO URL now (See https://confluence.hl7.org/display/TSMG/Terminology+Play+Book, and/or talk to TSMG)

# 02 - Information Message about using experimental CodeSystem. The code system is only for example use in this IG and only used by example resources. The CodeSystem follows the requirements on TSMG
Reference to experimental CodeSystem http://hl7.org/fhir/us/safr/CodeSystem/SAFRHealthareCapacityGroupCSExample|1.0.0-ballot
INFORMATION: CodeSystem/SAFRHealthareCapacityCSExample: CodeSystem: Most code systems defined in HL7 IGs will need to move to THO later during the process. Consider giving this code system a THO URL now (See https://confluence.hl7.org/display/TSMG/Terminology+Play+Book, and/or talk to TSMG)

# 03 - Deprecated pattern slicing from an inherited US Core profile
INFORMATION: StructureDefinition/nhsn-submitting-organization: StructureDefinition.snapshot.element[9].slicing.discriminator[0]: The discriminator type 'pattern' is deprecated in R5+. For future compatibility, you could consider using type=value with a pattern[x] instead (if this is not an inherited slicing)

# 04 - Repeating pattern requirement inherited from US Core organization
INFORMATION: StructureDefinition/nhsn-submitting-organization: StructureDefinition.snapshot.element[10].pattern.ofType(Identifier): The repeating element has a pattern. The pattern will apply to all the repeats (this has not been clear to all users)
INFORMATION: StructureDefinition/nhsn-submitting-organization: StructureDefinition.snapshot.element[11].pattern.ofType(Identifier): The repeating element has a pattern. The pattern will apply to all the repeats (this has not been clear to all users)
INFORMATION: StructureDefinition/nhsn-submitting-organization: StructureDefinition.snapshot.element[12].pattern.ofType(Identifier): The repeating element has a pattern. The pattern will apply to all the repeats (this has not been clear to all users)

# 05 - Information Message regarding a deprecated extension (maxValueSet), that was inherited through the FHIR R4 standard itself.
INFORMATION: StructureDefinition/nhsn-submitting-organization: StructureDefinition.snapshot.element[4].binding.extension[0]: The extension http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/elementdefinition-maxValueSet|5.2.0 is deprecated

# 06 - Per CQFM - Computable measures must use text/cql-expression or text/cql-identifier for all criteria
The expression language text/cql-identifier is not supported, so can't be validated

# 07 - Warning derived from a profile that was inherited from. Default behavior is acceptable
WARNING: StructureDefinition/nhsn-submitting-organization: StructureDefinition.snapshot.element[35].binding.valueSet: There are multiple different potential matches for the url 'http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/ValueSet/us-core-usps-state'. It might be a good idea to fix to the correct version to reduce the likelihood of a wrong version being selected by an implementation/implementer. Using version '7.0.0', found versions: 3.1.1, 6.1.0, 7.0.0

# 08 - This IG is using the last published version of these specifications
WARNING: ImplementationGuide/hl7.fhir.us.safr: ImplementationGuide.dependsOn[0]: The ImplementationGuide uses package hl7.fhir.us.core#7.0.0 released on 2024-05-08, but the most recent version is 8.0.0-ballot. This reference is getting old and the more recent version should be considered
WARNING: ImplementationGuide/hl7.fhir.us.safr: ImplementationGuide.dependsOn[7]: The ImplementationGuide uses package hl7.fhir.us.qicore#6.0.0 released on 2024-03-01, but the most recent version is 7.0.0-ballot. This reference is getting old and the more recent version should be considered

# 09 - The entry in bundle represents data included per the requirements of the IG (All referenced resources must be included in bundle), but not explicitly identified as a slice.
INFORMATION: Bundle/HospitalBedCapacityReportBundle: Bundle.entry[3]: This element does not match any known slice defined in the profile http://hl7.org/fhir/us/safr/StructureDefinition/safr-measurereport-bundle|1.0.0-ballot (this may not be a problem, but you should check that it's not intended to match a slice)
