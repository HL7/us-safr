# 1 - IG Defined CodeSystem represents a CodeSystem defined by NHSN specifically for the program that this IG addresses. THis IG defines the CodeSystem for use of these codes in the FHIR ecosystem
INFORMATION: CodeSystem/HRDSupplyDaysCS: CodeSystem: Most code systems defined in HL7 IGs will need to move to THO later during the process. Consider giving this code system a THO URL now (See https://confluence.hl7.org/display/TSMG/Terminology+Play+Book, and/or talk to TSMG)

# 2 - Deprecated pattern slicing from an inherited US Core profile
INFORMATION: StructureDefinition/nhsn-submitting-organization: StructureDefinition.snapshot.element[9].slicing.discriminator[0]: The discriminator type 'pattern' is deprecated in R5+. For future compatibility, you could consider using type=value with a pattern[x] instead (if this is not an inherited slicing)

# 2 - Repeating pattern requirement inherited from US Core organization
INFORMATION: StructureDefinition/nhsn-submitting-organization: StructureDefinition.snapshot.element[10].pattern.ofType(Identifier): The repeating element has a pattern. The pattern will apply to all the repeats (this has not been clear to all users)
INFORMATION: StructureDefinition/nhsn-submitting-organization: StructureDefinition.snapshot.element[11].pattern.ofType(Identifier): The repeating element has a pattern. The pattern will apply to all the repeats (this has not been clear to all users)
INFORMATION: StructureDefinition/nhsn-submitting-organization: StructureDefinition.snapshot.element[12].pattern.ofType(Identifier): The repeating element has a pattern. The pattern will apply to all the repeats (this has not been clear to all users)

# 3 - Information Message regarding a deprecated extension (maxValueSet), that was inherited through the FHIR R4 standard itself.
INFORMATION: StructureDefinition/nhsn-submitting-organization: StructureDefinition.snapshot.element[4].binding.extension[0]: The extension http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/elementdefinition-maxValueSet|5.2.0 is deprecated
