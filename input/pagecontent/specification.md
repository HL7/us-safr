This section of the implementation guide (IG) defines the specific conformance requirements for systems wishing to conform to this US SAFR Reporting IG. The bulk of it focuses on evaluating facility data against measure criteria and submitting those data to NHSN, though it also provides guidance on privacy, security, and other implementation requirements.

### Pre-reading

Before reading this formal specification, implementers should first familiarize themselves with two other key portions of the specification:

* The [Actors](actors.html) and [Use Cases](usecases.html) pages provide context for the intent and general process flow of this formal specification, as well as details on the various actors involved.


### Conventions

This implementation guide (IG) uses specific terminology to flag statements that have relevance for the evaluation of conformance with the guide:

* **SHALL** indicates requirements that must be met to be conformant with the specification.

* **SHOULD** indicates behaviors that are strongly recommended (and which may result in interoperability issues or sub-optimal behavior if not adhered to), but which do not, for this version of the specification, affect the determination of specification conformance.

* **MAY** describes optional behaviors that are free to consider but are not a recommendation for or against adoption.

#### Must Support ###

The following rules regarding Must Support  elements apply to all Profiles in this guide. The Must Support definitions are not inherited from other IGs, even for profiles in this guide derived from another guide.

Sender:

* If the data element is available in the FHIR API/EHR, the data element *SHALL* be provided (either through submission or response to a query) for measure calculation or risk adjustment.
* If the sender does not capture/store the data, the data are not available, or sharing of the data is not authorized, the system **SHOULD NOT** send the element if the element is not marked as mandatory (lower cardinality of 0).

Receiver: 

* The receiver **SHALL** be capable of processing resource instances containing must-support data elements without generating an error or causing the application to fail.
* The receiver **SHALL** be able to process resource instances containing must-support data elements asserting missing information (data absent reason extension).

#### Profiles

This specification makes significant use of [FHIR profiles]({{site.data.fhir.path}}profiling.html) and terminology artifacts to describe the content to be shared as part of measure report submissions.

The full set of profiles defined in this IG can be found by following the links on the [Artifacts](artifacts.html) page.

#### Reporting Scenarios

The following reporting scenarios use the Actors defined on the [Actors](actors.html) and [Use Cases](usecases.html) pages.

#### Push to NHSN

In this scenario both the Data Source and dQM evaluation engine reside at the reporting facility, and may be the same system (i.e. an EHR that performs itâ€™s own internal measure evaluation). The dQM Evaluation Engine first retrieves the latest FHIR measures and related resources from the Measure Source and extracts the data requirements for each measure. The dQM Evaluation Engine and queries the Data Source for data that it will evaluate against a measure and prepares Bundle containing MeasureReport and supporting resources, then sends it to the Measure Report Recipient at NHSN. The Measure Report Recipient then optionally performs pre-qualification (additional FHIR validation checks against measure-specific profiles) before making the data available to NHSN back end systems.

In this scenario the dQM Evaluation Engine SHALL perform a FHIR POST or PUT to push the measure report bundle to the Measure Report Recipient.

1. **Retrieve Measure Bundle:** The dQM Evaluation Engine uses an HTTP GET against the Measure Source for an [SafrMeasureBundle](StructureDefinition-us-safr-measure-bundle.html) containing a [CQFMContinuousVariableMeasure]({{site.data.fhir.ver.cqfm}}/StructureDefinition-cv-measure-cqfm.html) <!--[CRMIShareableMeasure]({{site.data.fhir.ver.crmi}}/StructureDefinition-crmi-shareablemeasure.html)--> and related resources. The exact Bundle(s) to retrieve is determined out of band by the facility and NHSN during onboarding and subsequent discussions. After retrieving the Bundle, the dQM evaluation engine parses the contents to determine which resources are needed from the Data Source, then proceeds to step 2.

2. **Query Data Sources:**


3. **Submit MeasureReport Bundle** The dQM Evaluation Engine uses an HTTP POST to submit the [SafrMeasureReportBundle](StructureDefinition-safr-measurereport-bundle.html) to the MeasureReport Recipient. The MeasureReport Recipient validates the Bundle and proceeds to load the data into other NHSN systems (details of such systems are out of scope for this IG).

4. **Forward to NHSN Systems:** The MeasureReport Recipient fowards the validated MeasureReport Bundle content to other back-end NHSN systems (details of such systems are out of scope for this IG).



#### Pull direct from NHSN 
In this scenario, both the Digital Quality Measure (dQM) Evaluation Engine and the Measure Report Recipient reside within an NHSN controlled environment, and may be the same system. The dQM Evaluation Engine first retrieves the latest FHIR measures and related resources from the Measure Source and extracts the data requirements for each measure. The dQM Evaluation Engine queries the Data Source for data that it will evaluate against a measure and prepares Bundle containing MeasureReport and supporting resources, and then optionally performs pre-qualification (additional FHIR validation checks against measure-specific profiles) before making the data available to NHSN back end systems.

In this scenario the Data Source SHALL have a FHIR API that at a minimum provides read access to all resources required by the measure(s).

After retrieving the Bundle, the dQM evaluation engine parses the contents to determine which resources are needed from the Data Source, then proceeds to step 2.

2. **Query Data Sources:**


3. **Submit MeasureReport Bundle** The dQM Evaluation Engine uses an HTTP POST to submit the [SafrMeasureReportBundle](StructureDefinition-safr-measurereport-bundle.html) to the MeasureReport Recipient. The MeasureReport Recipient validates the Bundle and proceeds to load the data into other NHSN systems (details of such systems are out of scope for this IG).
