information1 = This file stores the OID assignments for resources defined in this IG.
information2 = It must be added to git and committed when resources are added or their id is changed
information3 = You should not generally need to edit this file, but if you do:
information4 = (a) you can change the id of a resource (left side) if you change it's actual id in your source, to maintain OID consistency
information5 = (b) you can change the oid of the resource to an OID you assign manually. If you really know what you're doing with OIDs
information6 = There is never a reason to edit anything else
